## Introduction
I borrowed a hugo theme named Hugo Apéro to create my own virtual apéro. Based on the introduction page of this hugo theme, apéro is a unique kind of casual get-together in French culture, when you gather with friends and get to know each other better over some apéritifs, snacks, and anything in between. This website is developed to host my learning experience and projects.
