  ‘Hello world!’ This greeting may be familiar to you if you are an expert in programming or are just beginning your journey in this field. It is often the first sentence you are asked to print on your screen, and I would like to greet you with it as well. As fellow data enthusiasts, no matter where you are on this planet, we share a common interest and language in the world of data. :)

  As a consultant with almost a decade of experience in the energy industry, I've been working with utility clients across the United States to identify and quantify energy-saving opportunities, design demand-side management (DSM) programs, and evaluate their effectiveness. I obtained my degree in Environmental Management from Duke University and have been keeping up with the fast-paced changes in the energy field, such as the emergence of new technologies and the availability of massive amounts of customer data. My ultimate goal is to use my expertise to help bring these innovative measures to customers through utility program channels.
  
  During my spare time, I enjoy dedicating myself to self-learning various data techniques and tools, and I have been a dedicated member of several online learning platforms, including Coursera and Udemy. Recently, I decided to create a personal website to document some of the cool projects I've worked on and to keep track of my ongoing learning experiences. By doing so, I hope to share my passion for data with others and showcase the practical applications of the techniques and tools I have acquired.
