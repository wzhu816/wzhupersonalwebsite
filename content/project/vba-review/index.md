Excel still dominates the business world, even though challenged by emerging programming languages such as Python and R. However, it is known to many professionals that the fact of its lacking a solid application architecture can lead to devastating consequences. In many work environments, people tend to build on existing template workbooks without understanding the preassumptions or restrictions of the template workbooks, undocumentating any changes or modifications, and untesting the results after completing the analyses. The problem can get even worse if multiple people are working on the same project and building analyses on the same template workbook. It is highly likely that people make different mistakes and therefore endanger the quality of final deliverables.

## Streamline Workflow

A good practice is separating the tasks and build up modules accordingly. I've encountered many circumstances where a project requests for same type of analyses/modeling for several markets, but each market can have different assumptions or inputs to consider. A good strategy in this case is dividing the procedure into three components:
+ Inputs
+ Calculations/Modeling
+ Outputs

With limitation of human interference in modeling and reporting phases, the chances of getting erroneous results are greatly reduced. No need to mention how much more efficient it becomes and thus reduce the time needed for the project!

The calculations and modeling can be built from **VBA** and shared from projects to projects, people to people by modules. This makes knowledge more transparent and transferable.

## Perform Review

Quality Control (QC) is a very important step to maintain the approach consistency and results accuracy. The QC scripts can be developed to gather all the reporting files and red-flag those suspicious results. The core principle is to identify the appropriate metrics that can be used to screen out any outliers or discrepancies. 

I have extensive experience in selecting the correct set of metrics and designing reliable QC files. Please let me know if there's anything I can help with for your business!
