title: Econometric Series III ‚Äì Instrumental Variables (IV)

<span style="color:brown">**Instrumental Variables (IV)**</span> is one of many ways to estimate true causal effect when the treatment variable is endogenous. Endogeneity issue arises when the key regressor is correlated with error term, `$cov(x,Œµ)‚â†0$`. In other words, the endogenous variable is affected by some other variables that are also correlated with the outcome. This can happen in one or more scenarios listed below[^endo]:

*i)	The presence of an omitted variable where it correlates with both the treatment variable and the outcome variable.*

*ii)	The existence of measure error with the treatment variable `$x$`.*
	
*iii) The occurrence of simultaneous causality bias or reverse causation, i.e. when `$x$` causes `$y$` and `$y$` causes `$x$`.*

### Structural Form vs Reduced Form

Let‚Äôs consider a simple linear model `$y= Œ≤_0+ Œ≤_1 x_1+Œ≤_2 x_2+Œµ$`, where `$x_2$` is assumed to be exogenous. `$Œ≤_1$` is the parameter we are interested in estimating and it represents the marginal effect of `$x_1$` on `$y$`. 
+ Reduced form is when `$x_1$` is also exogenous. OLS can be applied to the reduced form. 
+ Structural form is when `$x_1$` becomes endogenous, and OLS estimate would be biased. 

One way to resolve the endogeneity issue is to find an appropriate IV. You may ask whether `$x_2$` can be used as the IV, but the answer is no ‚ùå üòî  

Because even though it satisfies exogeneity condition and maybe relevance condition, it does not meet the requirement of exclusion restriction condition. <span style="text-decoration:underline">If there is only one IV, `$Œ≤_1$` is just-identified and can be estimated with the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)</span>. This is called the IV estimator.  `$Œ≤_1$` is over-identified or under-identified if there are multiple IVs or no excluded exogenous variable, respectively. 

##### One thing to remember is that IV is not as efficient as OLS and may suffer from finite sample bias when the IV has weak correlation with the regressor (so-called ‚Äúweak instruments‚Äù). It might be a good idea to use more than one IV (over-identification) to isolate as much exogenous part of the regressor as possible.

### Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)

The 2SLS is an extension of the OLS model and is widely used in the analysis of structural equations. As the name suggests, the estimation is carried out in two stages[^2sls]:

**First stage:** estimate the reduced-form equations

**Second stage:** estimate the structural equations using first stage predictions as instruments

Back to the model above, let‚Äôs fix the endogeneity issue by executing the 2SLS procedure:

*<span style="color:brown">First stage:</span>*
Let‚Äôs specify a model for `$x_1$`:  `$x_1= Œ±_0+Œ±_1 x_2+Œ±_2Z+u$`,

where `$Z$` , refers to the instrumental variable (IV), satisfies the three assumptions:

‚úîÔ∏è It affects `$x_1$` ‚Äì *<span style="color:green">relevance condition checked</span>*.

‚úîÔ∏è It is not affected by other factors and therefore is exogenous (i.e., `$cov(Z,u)=0$`) ‚Äì *<span style="color:green">exogeneity condition checked</span>*.

‚úîÔ∏è It does not affect y directly and only through:  `$x_1$` ‚Äì *<span style="color:green">exclusion restriction condition checked</span>*.

Now, after we run the regression using OLS, we obtain the estimated coefficients, and generate the predicted `$\hat{x_1}$`:
$$\hat{x_1} = \hat{\alpha_0} + \hat{\alpha_1}x_2 +  \hat{\alpha_2}Z$$

*<span style="color:brown">Second stage:</span>*
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\hat{x_1} + \beta_2\hat{x_2} + Œµ$$

The 2SLS can be used widely when: 

1) `$y$` and `$x_1$` are both continuous variables, or
2) `$y$` is discrete while `$x_1$` is continuous, or
3) `$y$` is continuous while `$x_1$` is discrete - in this case, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedures.

2SLS can‚Äôt be applied if `$y$` and `$x_1$` are both discrete variables, and instead we would use a MLE method to estimate both equations simultaneously.

#### *Exogeneity test:* 
We‚Äôve known that endogeneity is created by unobservables that influence both the key regressor and the outcome. And we would want to measure those unobservables and include them in the model. Though we can‚Äôt measure those unobservables directly, we can approximate them by leveraging the residuals, `$u$`, the error term. We can obtain the predicted residuals, `$\hat{u}=x_1-\hat{x_1}$` and include them into the original linear equation, `$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\delta\hat{u}+Œµ$`. If the estimated parameter of the residuals, `$\hat{\delta}$` is significant, then there is still endogeneity. Or, if `$\hat{\delta}$` is not significant, it is tested to be no endogeneity.
