title: A Brief Introduction of Demand Response
---

#### *You may have heard of Demand Response (DR) even if you're not an energy professional. Perhaps you've come across programs like the "bring-your-own-kW" initiative on your utility company's website, and you're curious about what demand response means and how these programs work. In this blog, I'll provide a concise overview of demand response and delve into the different types of DR programs available.*

DR is a strategy that aims to reduce demand during the system’s peak periods by incentivizing customers to reduce non-essential electricity usage or shift their load to a different time. By responding to price signals or other incentives, end-use consumers can receive compensation for their participation in the program. It’s important to note that reducing net usage is not always necessary to benefit from DR. DR is dispatchable in both space and time, which means that it can deployed precisely when and where it is needed. This flexibility makes DR a valuable resource for utilities and grid operators, as it allows them to respond quickly to changing conditions and balance supply and demand more effectively.

DR programs come in many different varieties, but they can generally be classified along two dimensions: *the customer motivation method* and *the conditions under which load reductions (or “events”) are called*.

+ ***Load-response programs*** are a type of demand response program in which utilities offer payments to customers in exchange for reducing their electricity demand during specific periods. One form of load response is emergency demand response, which is activated during system contingencies when customer load reduction is needed to relieve generation and/or transmission or distribution capacity constraints.

+ ***Price-response programs*** are another type of demand response program in which customers voluntarily reduce their demand in response to market prices. Under these programs, customers reduce their load during periods when the cost of reducing demand is less than the cost of purchasing electricity. This approach can be particularly effective in managing peak demand periods when electricity prices are highest.



#### Load-Response Programs

##### *The program participants can be considered as “sellers”, since they sell their ability to consume electricity in exchange for economic incentives offered by the utility. These load-response programs can take different forms depending on several program design components and targeted customers, and they typically do not require a change in the billing system.*

##### o	Direct Load Control

<ul><i>Target group</i>: residential customers and small commercial customers (<100 kW)</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: End-use loads (i.e., AC cooling, heating, or water heating and pool pumps in residential programs) turned off for limited periods of time.</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: Load switches, 2-way communication (“smart thermostats”, optional)</ul>

##### o	Curtailable Load

<ul><i>Target group</i>: Medium to large commercial and industrial customers (100-500 kW peak demand)</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: End-use loads reduced or turned off for limited periods of time.</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: Interval meters, automated controls, 2-way communication (optional)</ul>

##### o	Interruptible Load

<ul><i>Target group</i>: Large commercial and industrial customers (>500 kW peak demand, typically >1 MW)</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: All or major portions of customer total load turned off for periods of time.</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: Interval meters, backup generator (optional)</ul>

##### o	Scheduled Load

<ul><i>Target group</i>: All customers</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: Load reduction scheduled ahead of time.</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: None necessary</ul>



#### Load-Response Programs

##### *The program participants voluntarily reduce their demand in response to high energy prices during peak periods (price signals). Implementing this type of program may require changes to the customer's billing system.*

##### o	Time-of-Use (TOU)

<ul><i>Target group</i>: All customers</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: Load management involves a stepped-rate structure based on the time of day, including peak, off-peak, and sometimes shoulder peak rate.</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: TOU meters, real-time or prior-day energy information accessed by customers via Internet or other means</ul>

##### o	Dynamic Pricing (Critical-Peak Pricing or Real-Time Pricing)

<ul><i>Target group</i>: All customers</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: Load management involves a dynamic tariff that changes based on real-time or near-real-time conditions.

+ Under Critical-Peak Pricing (CPP), a time-dependent rate that is several times higher than the normal rate is added to the standard or TOU rates during peak periods.

+ Under Real-Time Pricing (RTP), customers are exposed to the real-time costs of electricity in the wholesale power market, which can be highly variable and volatile.
</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: Interval meters, 2-way communication, energy information via Internet</ul>

##### o	Demand Bidding

<ul><i>Target group</i>: All customers</ul>
<ul><i>Target load reduction</i>: Customers bid to reduce their load without requiring changes to their billing system by either accepting a provider-proposed price, or submitting their own proposed price.</ul>
<ul><i>Enabling technologies</i>: Interval meters, web-based trading/market platforms, spot price information via Internet</ul>



Demand response programs have become increasingly popular in the electric utility industry, as they provide a valuable tool for grid stabilization and reducing the need for costly grid upgrades. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) publishes report on demand response and advanced metering annually. According to their 2022 assessment report, demand resources in wholesale markets increased by 6% from 2020 to 2021, while potential peak demand savings from retail demand response programs decreased by 5% from 2019 to 2020. Despite this, customer enrollment in both retail dynamic pricing and demand response programs increased, suggesting a continued interest and adoption of these programs. As such, demand response programs remain an important tool for grid stabilization and energy management in the U.S.
